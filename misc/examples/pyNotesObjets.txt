int object is immutable,

1 >>> x = 1000 # new object x is created
2 >>> x = 500 # new object x is created

no way of reaching object that holds 1000 as x is now referring to 500

Strong typing means that the type of a value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl. Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.
