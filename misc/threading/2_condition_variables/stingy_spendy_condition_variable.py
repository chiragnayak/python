condition variable

acquire() --> acquires the lock
release() --> releases the lock
wait() --> releases the lock automatically
notify() --> notifies single thread
notifyAll() --> notifies all threads

Note: The wait() method releases the lock, and then blocks until another thread awakens it by calling notify() or notify_all().
 Once awakened, wait() re-acquires the lock and returns. It is also possible to specify a timeout.

Note: the notify() and notify_all() methods donâ€™t release the lock; 
this means that the thread or threads awakened will not return from their wait() call immediately, 
but only when the thread that called notify() or notify_all() finally relinquishes ownership of the lock
