This directory fun_projects constitutes of various python based projects I developed out of
practicing and at the same time learning new stuff python is capable of.
Also to make mundane tasks easy.

I was always curious:
How the computer games are coded.
How websites are running so seamlessly.
How certain tasks can be automated to make space for more creative stuff.
How reminders work.
How UI interation and workflow is designed and implemented
etc etc


i hope these fun projects helps me and others to understand the magic of coding ..
